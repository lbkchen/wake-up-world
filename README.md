# Wake Up, World!

Wake Up, World is the alarm clock for social good. We strongly admired Watsi's mission to provide healthcare for everyone in the world, connecting more vulnerable and less developed regions to a global network of aid-giving. We believe that everyone has the innate desire to provide charitable aid, but it isn't always convenient, and opportunities are easy to pass by throughout the course of a busy workday. We are looking for tangential outlets for giving, and an alarm clock was the perfect choice for our project.

Our cooperation with the Watsi project was inspired by a common interest for technology and medicine, and our specific application focuses on tackling three key challenges:

## 1. The barrier to giving aid

## 2. Connecting people more personally to the patients they donate towards

## 3. The disparity of funding that various patients receive
